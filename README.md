# Image Compression and Decompression System

Model is trained on https://www.kaggle.com/nikhilpandey360/chest-xray-masks-and-labels dataset.

We have preprocessed the data by running 'preprocess.py'.
It will convert all images into specific dimensions.

'train/*' means all training images are placed in the 'train' folder.

For training the model,we have converted the dataset into .h5 file.
To convert into .h5 file, I have uploaded createh5.py file.

Please change the name respective of .h5 file name in config.py

Model is trained by running the command -
  python3 train.py -opt momentum --name my_network

Pretrained Model -

  The model is trained on 60 epochs with diagnostic-step size as 30.
  
  For Compressing and Decompressing the image we will run the command - 
    python3 compress.py -rl -i input_image_path -o random_output_image_name
  
For deployment of the model -

After training the model download the checkpoint and save it in the directory where app.py is stored.

Run command -
  python app.py
  
Go to browser and type http://localhost:5000/  to get the view of the system.

For uploading image you should upload the preproccesed image.

Output image will be stored in the 'output' folder.

Hope you will enjoy it!!!
